Environment
----------
- python 2.7
- python PIL (Pillow)

Run
-------
$ python main.py

Usage
-----
0. The current tool requires that **the images to be labeled reside in /Images/001, /Images/002, etc. You will need to modify the code if you want to label images elsewhere**.
1. Input a folder number (e.g, 1, 2, 5...), and click `Load`. The images in the folder, along with a few example results will be loaded.
2. To create a new bounding box, left-click to select the first vertex. Moving the mouse to draw a rectangle, and left-click again to select the second vertex.
  - To cancel the bounding box while drawing, just press `<Esc>`.
  - To delete a existing bounding box, select it from the listbox, and click `Delete`.
  - To delete all existing bounding boxes in the image, simply click `ClearAll`.
3. After finishing one image, click `Next` to advance. Likewise, click `Prev` to reverse. Or, input an image id and click `Go` to navigate to the speficied image.
  - Be sure to click `Next` after finishing a image, or the result won't be saved. 


For Video Sample to Image
-------
$ python sample_video.py   --outdir OUTPUT_DIR    --file INPUT_FILE	                                                    
		 (optional)--sam 5
(example :python sample_video.py --outdir ./001 --file ./1.mp4 --sam 1)

Usage
-----
Sample the video to images with sample rate --sam
The default sample rate is 1 frame per second
